# About Fields Sort

Neither the springfox-swagger official swagger-ui nor the SwaggerBootstrapUi have the features corresponding to the order of the interface fields when they are documented and the back-end fields when they are displayed

But SwaggerBootstrapUi in the later development, drawing on the views of developers, will be required fields and non-required fields are sorted, required fields in the first place, debugging is also so, convenient for developers joint testing
